# Docker Systems

A collection of my docker-compose files.
Not all of the configurations are in active use.

The files which are at the root folder are the same for every application.
The `traefik.yaml` file for example is used with all configurations which use Traefik.

The subfolders might include additional README files in case there is something
to be aware of.
